# PDF-data-extraction
I made a simple script for PDF data extraction. I needed to extract the name, age and sex from the first table, which was kind of easy. The tricky part was getting the G/T (weight, height) from the PDF using regex, because these were labeled with G= and T=, and it could get other things than what I needed. 

It can be modified to extract data from tables or using regex to extract specific data from the PDF.
